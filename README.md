# Mapping the Predominent Non-English Language in each Chicago Neighborhood**


### According to 2015 Census Data, 15.7% of Chicago's population does not speak English as their predominant language - approximately 400,000 residents. Spanish is the largest non English predomminant language spoken in the city, followed by Mandarin and Polish. I wanted to use the skills I gained this quarter to explore the distribution of these non English languages spatially, across Chicago. I used a data set from the Chicago Data Portal that provides the predominent non English language spoken in each of Chicago's 77 community areas. 


## Research Question 1: How does the predominant non English change over Chicago's community areas?

### I am currently interning for WBEZ, and I will be staying on there after college to work as a climate reporter. My work in journalism has made me absolutely fascinated by the interplay between storytelling, history and spatial data. My projects in previous quarters of this class have been very focused on data and data analysis, and this quarter, I wanted to push myself to incorporate an anecdotal aspect to my work. I was particularly impacted by our Week 4 readings on Feminist Data Visualization. I firmly believe that while spatial data analysis is incredibly powerful, we also have a responsibility to convey and embrace the socio-cultural contexts of our maps. I identified neighborhoods of interest from my map, each with unique predominenet non English languages, and did research about the history of that language and its speakers within the community area.


## Research Question 2: What historical and immigration trends contributed to the presence of a language within a community area? 


### A final, significant goal of this project was to make it as accessible as possible. I wanted a user to clearly identify the predominant non English language spoken in each neighborhood, and to learn more about the history of particular neighborhoods of interest by clicking on the neighborhoods. In order to do this, I used interactive tmap and StoryMap. 

### I was particularly eager to use StoryMap for this project, as it is a tool designed specifically for journalists to engage with spatial data in a storytelling context.

### My data was sourced from the Chicago Data Portal, and spans the years 2008-2012. It is linked [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Languages-spoken-in-Chicago-2008-2012/a2fk-ec6q).

### There are several places for improvement in this project. I was frustrated by how old the data I was working with was. The set spans the four years between 2008 - 2012 - over 10 yaers ago. The age of the data means the map, although interesting, is not a current snapshot of languages in Chicago. I would love to entirely redo this project with an updated and recent data set, and would be curious to see whether it captured any recent migration trends. If I had more time, I would also love to explor the OTHER non-English languages spoken in each neighborhood and see how their distribution might shed insight on different communities. 

## Methods

### I used R to clean my data and create the map which would function as my basemap throughout the project. The link to my R Markdown is here. I have also included a screenshot of my code here. 

### I used StoryMap to incorporate the archival and historical about different communities. You can learn more about my process of working with StoryMap in the StoryMap File!
